<p>Hey, 🖐 This is my MERN stack E-Commerce Website aiming to sell my kiddos clothes. Of course, selling is not the point. Honing my coding skill is the primary reason. </p>
<p>The stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js. Redux for the global state management. </p>
<p>Here is the deomo. 👉<strong>https://morning-castle-57375.herokuapp.com/</strong></p>
